Welome to the Magic Truck Dispatch Simulator!  The only game where you
have next to no control over the results!
Simply set up the configuration file according the the format described in
Configuration.java, kick off the code, and watch those trucks move!

All of the base configurations are very fast: while the system does sleep in
between each cycle, such that the sims always take 6:21 seconds to run. On my
computer the simulation is actually being calculated only about 27% of the time.
This is due to some pretty heavy optimization work: more details can be found in
the included report.

If you don't wish to see just how fast a modern computer is, simply tack a few
zeros onto the last number of each configuration file.  That number determines the
minimum amount of time each tick will have to elapse: if you increase it, you will
have a much cooler looking simulation (abet a slower one).
